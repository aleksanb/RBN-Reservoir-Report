\subsection{Creating functioning RBN reservoir systems}

\subsubsection{Temporal Parity with $N=3$}
There is an abundance of well-performing reservoirs for $K=2$ and $K=3$.
Reservoirs with higher connectivity have their fitnesses peak at higher values of input connectivity.
This is in line with the expectations from \cite{rbn-reservoir} described in section \ref{section:optimal-perturbance}.
The more chaotic the dynamics of the reservoir,
the more it has to be perturbed to retain the input information.

\subsubsection{Temporal Parity with $N=5$}
The distribution of well-performing reservoirs is shifted heavily towards $K=3$.
There are single outliers that perform well for $K=2$,
but the accuracy means are considerably lower than for the reservoirs with $K=3$.

Comparing the observed performance against the performace of the RRC systems benchmarked in \cite{rbn-reservoir} on the same task,
one sees the same drop in performance from Temporal Parity with $N=3$ to $N=5$.

\subsubsection{Computational Capability}
Comparing the Computational Capability plots for both tasks (Figures \ref{figure:results:temporal-parity-3} and \ref{figure:results:temporal-parity-5}),
one observes that the individuals with a higher Computational Capability have a tendency to be shifted towards higher accuracies.
The lower accuracy bounds are increased as compared to the samples located at $.0CC$.
This indicates a positive correlation between Computational Capability and performance,
again in line with the expectations from \cite{rbn-reservoir}.
One might be quick to assume that reservoirs achieving no higher than a $0.5$ accuracy perform no better than the tossing of a coin.
There is however no guarantee that the distribution of correct classifications follow a binomial model with $p=0.5$.

\subsubsection{Optimal Connectivity}
When comparing general performance across $K$ values on the two tasks,
the optimal connectivitity seems to be closer to $K=3$ than $K=2$.
As described in section \ref{section:rbns},
critical dynamics for heterogenous networks should be the most frequent at an average $\langle K \rangle = 2$.
Such networks can therefore contain subgraphs of both higher and lower connectivity,
while keeping the average connectivity the same.
This disparity can therefore be explained by the fact that an homogenous RBN with $K=3$ can emulate an RBN with lower connectivity by having two or more in-edges from the same ancestor node,
while an homogenous RBN with $K=2$ cannot emulate a higher-connectivity one.


\subsection{Evolving functionally equivalent RBN reservoirs for existing readout layers}

Talk about Genome representation, inefficient, better with binary string?
Luckily dominated by RBN-Reservoir simulation time
