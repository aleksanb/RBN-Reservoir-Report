\section{Conclusion}

It has also been suggested 29 that LSMs might present a useful framework
for modeling computations in gene regulation networks. These networks
also compute on time varying inputs (e.g., external signals) and
produce a multitude of time varying output signals (transcription rates of
genes). Furthermore these networks are composed of a very large number
of diverse subprocesses (transcription of transcription factors) that tend to
have each a somewhat different temporal dynamics 30

Kanskje det ja?
