\section{Background}

\subsection{A brief introduction to boolean networks}

Random Boolean Networks, also known as Kaffman networks, were originally developed as a model of genetic regulatory networks \cite{kauffman1969metabolic}.
The model makes no assumptions about the actual functioning of the nodes in the network,
making them useful to model a wide range of phenomena.
The simplification of a system to a boolean model doesn't pose a problem,
as any multi-valued network can be transformed to a corresponding binary one.

A RBN is usually described by its number of nodes $N$ and the in-degree $K$ of the nodes,
that is, how many nodes each node depends on (also known as its ancestors).
RBNs can have both homogenous and heterogenous in-degrees.
In heterogenous networks, one usually describes the average connectivity $<K>$ instead.

Each node can have a state of zero or one.
The next state of the node is solely determined by the current combination of states of its ancestors.
Each combination leads to a new state of zero or one,
with the probability given by a binomial distribution usually having $<p>=0.5$.
Figure \ref{figure:sample-homogenous-rbn} visualizes a homogenous RBN with N=3 K=2, and P=0.5.

    \end{tabular}
  }

In the classical RBN model (CRBN), all nodes update at the same time,
therefore the states of the network at $t+1$ only depends on the states at $t$.
This is a simplification that isn't quite accurate for all systems,
notably gene regulation networks where the system doesn't operate in lockstep.
There are therefore a number of updating schemes on the spectrum of determinism and randomness.

The dynamics of an RBN can be categorized as being in either the ordered, critical, or chaotic phase.
These phases can be identified by how large a part of the network state is able to change over time,
whether similar states tend to converge or diverge over time,
and the networks resistance to perturbations (outside changes to the network).

As these phases are easy to identify visually,
we will plot the states of the RBN in a square lattice,
with the network states plotted horizontally, and time flowing downwards.
A node is drawn as white if its state is one, black otherwise.
The phases are visualized in figure \ref{figure:rbn-phases}.

  \label{figure:rbn-phases}
\end{figure}

In general, RBNs in the critical phase are the most interesting.
These are seemingly able to support both information transmission, storage and modification,
capacities required for computation \cite{langton3computation}.
Critical systems are found on the edge of chaos, on the phase transition between ordered and chaotic networks.
For classical RBNs with $<p>=0.5$, critical networks are usually found at $<K>=2$ \cite{gershenson2004introduction},
although one could still create networks with similar dynamics for different $K$.

A thorough introduction to the field of RBNs is available in \cite{gershenson2004introduction}.

\subsection{RBN-Reservoir systems}

How does one adapt a RBN for use as a reservoir in a RBN-RC device?
RBNs aren't usually designed to take external input.
We do however, have the concept of perturbation,
the external flipping of bits in the networks state,
transition tables or edges.
This can be utilized to create RBNs that take input,
by continiously perturbing the RBN nodes by the bits of the input sequence.

Questions that follow are how many bits should the network consume at a time,
how many of the node in the network should be perturbed by the input at each timestep,
and how should one read out the values from the network.
Finally, what dynamics must such a reservoir contain to allow for the computation of interesting problems?

In \cite{rbn-reservoir} the authors create and analyze functioning RBN-RC systems.
These RBN-RC systems have heterogenous connectivity,
consume one bit of input at each timestep ($I=1$),
perturbing $L$ of the $N$ nodes in the process.
Such a setup is shown in figure \ref{figure:rbn-reservoir},
here shown with homogenous connectivity,
as will be used in this report.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{background/RBN-Reservoir.pdf}
  \caption{RBN-Reservoir system with $I=1, L=2, K=2, N=5$.
  Readout layer can be any node performing some kind of learning of the reservoir state against expected output for the current task (e.g. linear regression).}
  \label{figure:rbn-reservoir}
\end{figure}

The computational capability of an RBN as a reservoir is found to be at maximum when its ability to forget past perturbations
while simultaneoutly being able to separate diverged input sequences is maximized.
These two properties are coined \textit{fading memory} and \textit{separation property},
the computational capability $\Delta$ measured as the maximization of both.
Analyzing different RBN-reservoirs with this metric,
a high $\Delta$ is found to correlate with critical connectivity ($<K>=2$).

It is found that the optimal amount of reservoir perturbance,
adjustable by the number of connections between the input layer and the reservoir,
depends on both the task size, how many steps in time are required to be remembered,
and the dynamics of the reservoir.
\textit{Chaotic reservoirs} require few input connections to be able to properly spread information,
but perform poorly on larger tasks due to past perturbations still floating around the reservoir.
\textit{Ordered reservoirs} quickly forget past perturbations, allowing some success for larger tasks,
but their inability to remember past perturbations renders them useless for many tasks.
\textit{Critical reservoirs} require connectivity somewhere in the middle.
Able to forget as well as remember, they perform accurately independent of task size.

To measure the real-life performance and accuracy of the RBN-reservoir systems, two tasks were introduced: Temporal Density and Temporal Parity.
Both require the reservoir to be able to retain information for a sliding window of size $ n $,
offset by some value $ t $, back through the input stream.
The temporal Parity task requires us to determine if there were an odd number of ones in the sliding window,
the temporal density task to determine whether there were a majority of ones.
The former is visualized in figure \ref{figure:temporal-parity}.

  \caption{

    A one is visualized as white, while a zero is black.
    We see that correct output at time $i$ is equal to there being an odd number of $1$s in inputs $[i, i-1, i-2]$
