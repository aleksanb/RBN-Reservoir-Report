\subsection{Evolving reservoirs to re-use existing readout layers}

\todo[inline]{Yah this should probably be put somewhere else?}

It seems that for a random sample of reservoirs of a given size and connetivity,
the temporal density task is solveable for a larger $ n $ than the temporal parity one.
The parity task might therefore requires a more specialized network topology to function well.
Due to the seemingly increased complexity of separating the temporal parity task at low $ n $,
it was chosen as the main task in this paper.
